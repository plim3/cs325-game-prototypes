<h2>Pirates vs. Birds</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<p>
The birds are able to steal the pirates treasures by being able to take the coins.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<p>
When the birds collide with the coins, they are able to grab it away from the player.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<p>
I learned how to make an "enemy" that can sabatoge the player as well as the basics of Phaser. <br>
Easiest: Getting images and matching the pirate theme. <br>
Hardest: Coding the birds so that they are able to gather the coins.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<p>
I used the "FirstGame" example from Phaser to start my game off and added elements to it.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<p>
A pirate trying to find treasure and keeping the birds from taking his booty!
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<p>
Pirate
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<p>
Input: Keyboard <br>
Randomness: Deterministic <br>
Genre: Platformer <br>
Play Style: Collector
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<p>
Platforming and trying to evade enemies.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<p>
I want players to experience the excitement of dodging enemies while trying to collect the loot.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<p>
Using the arrows on your keyboard, you can move left/right using the left/right arrow keys and you can jump using the up arrow key. The objective of the game is to gather the most amount of coins while dodging the birds that will spawn after each round when the coins are collected. The birds are able to steal the player's coins. The game ends when the player hits a bird.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<p>
Playing it slowly and wait till the birds are on one side of the screen to gather loot is an effective strategy.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<p>
The world is set on an island where the pirate tries to collect all the treasure and gold coins in the island. However, there are birds that want to make the pirate's life miserable and try to steal his coins. The pirate is fighting to gather the most amount of coins without the birds stealing them from him. 
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<p>
People who want to play a platformer with a pirate theme.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<p>
It depends on how long the player can last without hitting the birds. It can last from 10 seconds to 2 minutes.
</p>
